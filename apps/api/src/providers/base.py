"""
Market-data provider PORT (the facade boundary).

GammaFlow's engine and signals layers consume plain dicts and never import a vendor SDK.
This module formalizes that boundary: a data source plugs in by subclassing
`MarketDataProvider` and translating its vendor payloads into the TypedDict contracts
below. Swapping Massive for another vendor means writing one new adapter + registering it
in `src/providers/__init__.py` -- no change to engine.py, signals.py, or main.py.

The TypedDicts ARE the contract. An adapter is correct iff it returns these shapes.
