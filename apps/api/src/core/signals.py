"""
Signals layer: turns a computed market_state into ranked, explainable trade setups.

This is interpretation, not new measurement -- it reads the gamma/vol/level fields the
engine already produces and applies a transparent, regime-first rule set:

  1. Regime (net_gex sign) decides the playbook: positive gamma -> mean-reversion /
     premium-selling; negative gamma -> momentum / premium-buying.
  2. Levels (walls, peak GEX, VWAP bands) provide entries/targets.
  3. The IV/HV ratio biases structure (sell vs buy premium).
  4. Confluence (multiple factors agreeing) raises conviction and the opportunity score.

All thresholds are module constants so they are easy to tune. Every setup carries a
plain-English rationale so the downstream AI (and you) can see why it fired.
