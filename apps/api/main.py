    Two ticker-load-experience moves live here (ARCH §4 + §5.1), acquisition-only — neither
    touches the `compute_ticker` transform; same inputs in → byte-identical bundle out:

    - CHAIN PRE-WARM (§4): if a live session for this ticker holds a FRESH shared chain snapshot
      (capture age ≤ CHAIN_PREWARM_MAX_AGE_SECONDS), the chain INPUT is short-circuited to it
      (a near-zero-cost shared-hit) instead of paying the ~3.5s cold chain re-fetch. Best-effort:
      any miss/stale/store error falls back to a normal vendor fetch with no error surfaced
      (`[best-effort-isolated-or-null]`). The shared market_data is READ-ONLY (never mutated).

    - 3-FETCH CONCURRENCY (§5.1): the three fetches overlap (gather of `to_thread` calls) rather
      than running sequentially. Per-stage best-effort isolation SURVIVES concurrency: each fetch
      keeps its own None/empty fallback and one fetch's failure NEVER cancels or corrupts the
      others (`return_exceptions=True` + per-call containment, never a fail-fast gather). When the
      chain is a pre-warm hit, only daily + intraday are fetched concurrently.

    Observability honesty (§6): the `vendor_fetch` span wraps the concurrent acquisition; each
    fetch keeps its own `vendor_call` timing. A pre-warmed chain records a `shared_hit` vendor_call
    whose near-zero duration reflects reality (not a fabricated vendor latency), and a `chain_source`
    marker is stamped on the trace for the operator readout — purely additive, operator-only.
