r"""path_guard.py — PreToolUse hook: lane-fence file writes to this repo (system-4b).

Completes the lane enforcement the per-role tool-allowlists (system-4) start. Tool-allowlists say WHICH
tools a role may use; this says WHERE they may write. It blocks Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit whose
target resolves OUTSIDE this repo root — so a session in the backend repo (C:\Dev\GammaFlow) cannot
write into the sibling frontend repo (C:\Dev\gammaflow-web) or arbitrary disk paths, and vice-versa
(install the mirror copy in gammaflow-web). One carve-out: the per-project Claude auto-memory store
(~/.claude/projects/<proj>/memory) is allowed — a sanctioned harness write location, not a cross-repo
code path.

Wire as a PreToolUse hook in `.claude/settings.json` matching Write|Edit|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit. Reads
the hook payload on stdin; exit 0 = allow, exit 2 + stderr = block (the standard hook deny signal).
Fail-open on any malformed/unknown input so it never wedges a session. Stdlib only.
