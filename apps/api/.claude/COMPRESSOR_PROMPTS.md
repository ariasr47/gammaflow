# Context Compressors (standing reference)

Reusable prompts to distill a session into a portable, self-contained artifact. Every
artifact assumes the reader has ONLY `.claude/GAMMAFLOW_CONTEXT.md` (the constant ground
truth) plus the inbound contract — never chat history.

Placeholders: `{FEATURE}` = kebab folder name under `.claude/contracts/`; `{TARGET_ROLE}`;
`{CONTRACT_NAME}` = output filename.

## 1. Universal Context Compressor (general)
Use to capture *any* session's work into one handoff/continuation file.

```text
Compress everything decided in THIS session into a single self-contained Markdown artifact.
The reader will have ONLY .claude/GAMMAFLOW_CONTEXT.md plus this artifact — no chat history.
Capture: the goal, the decisions made (not the deliberation), any constraints that must not
be violated, the resulting spec/plan, what's done vs open, and concrete next steps. EXCLUDE
reasoning, alternatives explored, and dead-ends. Be decision-dense, prefer bullets.
Write it to .claude/contracts/{FEATURE}/{CONTRACT_NAME}.md, then print the path and a
5-bullet summary.
```

## 2. Session-Transition Compressor (role → role)
Run at the Exit of Architect and PM. Targets the next role's needs.

```text
Compress THIS session into a contract for the next role: {TARGET_ROLE}.
Reader has ONLY .claude/GAMMAFLOW_CONTEXT.md + this contract.
Include exactly the sections {TARGET_ROLE} needs to act (use that contract's template in
.claude/contracts/{FEATURE}/). Restate any binding constraint they must not violate. Stay in
your lane: the Architect emits no UI/endpoints; the PM emits no code/math. EXCLUDE your
rationale — ship decisions, not deliberation.
Write to .claude/contracts/{FEATURE}/{CONTRACT_NAME}.md; print the path + a 5-bullet summary.
```

## 3. Split Context Compressor (decoupled execution)
Run at the Exit of the UX/Tech-Writer session. Emits the FE↔BE glue + two lane contracts.

```text
Compress THIS session into THREE files for decoupled execution:
1) .claude/contracts/{FEATURE}/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md — the FE↔BE data contract ONLY:
   endpoints, payload fields (names, types, presence rules), and error/SSE semantics. Both
   sides bind to this; it is the single source of integration truth.
2) .claude/contracts/{FEATURE}/BACKEND_EXECUTION_CONTRACT.md — server work only; references
   the interface contract for what it must EMIT; contains NO UI detail.
3) .claude/contracts/{FEATURE}/FRONTEND_EXECUTION_CONTRACT.md — UI work only; references the
   interface contract for what it CONSUMES + the component states; contains NO server internals.
Each must be self-contained against GAMMAFLOW_CONTEXT.md + the interface contract. EXCLUDE
rationale. Print the three paths.
```

## 4. Session-Resume Compressor (continue long work in a fresh tab)
When a single working session gets long/expensive, snapshot it to resume cleanly elsewhere.

```text
I'm about to continue this work in a fresh session. Write a resume note to
.claude/contracts/{FEATURE}/RESUME.md capturing: current objective, what's already done
(files changed + decisions locked), what's in-progress and exactly where it stopped, the
next concrete step, and any gotchas discovered. Self-contained against GAMMAFLOW_CONTEXT.md.
No narration of how we got here — just the state needed to pick up cold.
```

### Conventions
- **Claude Code sessions (repo access):** open each role with *"Read .claude/GAMMAFLOW_CONTEXT.md
  and .claude/contracts/{FEATURE}/{X}.md, then act as …"* — reference files, don't paste.
- **Plain web chat:** paste the file contents at the top instead.
- One feature = one folder under `.claude/contracts/`. Archive/delete when shipped.
- `GAMMAFLOW_CONTEXT.md` is the CONSTANT (read by every session); contracts are the VARIABLE.
