# BACKLOG — idea pool + roadmap discovery (standing reference)

> The divergent half of roadmap-advancement. The Orchestrator's **GATE I** (see
> `.claude/ORCHESTRATOR.md` §3) grooms this pool, culls to ONE next feature, and emits that as a
> per-feature `BRIEF.md` that seeds the pipeline. This file holds the candidates; it is NOT a
> commitment — promotion to a feature folder happens only through GATE I.
>
> Seeded from the deferred/open items already in `OPEN_THREADS.md`. Keep it current: when a thread
> ships, migrate its "deferred seams" here; when an item is promoted, mark it `→ promoted`.

## How an item earns promotion (the cull, from GATE I)
1. **Decision-impact test** — name the *trading decision* it improves and *how you'd observe* the
   improvement. No answer ⇒ parked, not promoted. (Mirrors the "AC observable without code" rule
   and the AI over-trading gate — we resist shiny features the same way we resist over-trading.)
2. **Feasibility gate** — data coverage + math invariants. Blocked items name their blocker.
3. **Score** — Value (H/M/L to the trading edge) × Effort (S/M/L); flag any locked invariant touched.

## Standing harvest sources (where the next wave comes from)
- **Deferred items** — `OPEN_THREADS.md` §7 + the "deferred seams" line inside each shipped thread.
- **Open strategic questions** — `OPEN_THREADS.md` §1/§9 (vendor + overnight).
- **Usage friction** — what's painful in your own daily trading use (capture as you hit it).
- **Downstream-AI quality** — does the `strategy_prompt` / `reassessment_prompt` hand-off produce
  better calls? Gaps here are first-class features.
- **Lifted constraints** — when a data/vendor limit lifts (e.g. overnight coverage), the features it
  was blocking become buildable.

## Last GATE I — 2026-06-22 (pipeline had drained; 4 features archived)
**Chosen → `trader-personas`** (the only candidate clearing both decision-impact + feasibility;
Value H × Effort M). Brief at `.claude/contracts/trader-personas/BRIEF.md`; entry = architect-first.
Cull verdicts (so the next discovery doesn't re-litigate):
- **Parked, cleanliness/no observed friction:** flip-anchoring (user confirmed flip is fine),
  wall-distance guard (hasn't shown up live).
- **Blocked-on a decision/measurement (not a build):** vendor/overnight (cost-eval decision first),
  flip fixed-IV modeling (measure the divergence first).
- **Parked, scope/justification:** ghost-trade→real path (scope shift off paper-sim), multi-session
  dark-pool (dark-pool is locked context-only, never directional — §8), observability extensions
  (operator-facing, not a trading decision), multi-ticker scanner (revisits the single-ticker
  decision; needs re-justification).

## Pool

### A. Queued / in-mind (decided to build next)
- *(empty — pipeline drained; next feature TBD at the next GATE I)*
- **trader-personas** — `✓ SHIPPED + ARCHIVED (2026-06-22)` → `_archive/trader-personas/`. Both lanes
  landed (backend `1026190`; frontend `6dcdbe1`/`1233718`); persona reframes the AI hand-off only,
  gate/score/tier/fingerprint byte-identical, FE-rendered assembly. Seams it left → section D.
  (`OPEN_THREADS` §7)

### B. Ready candidates (feasible, small, unscheduled)
- **Live gamma-flip anchoring** — outside RTH, anchor the flip search to `gex_spot` (close) not the
  live mid, so a gapped pre-market anchor can't select a different crossing; also drop the per-tick
  `Gamma flip $…` INFO log to debug. *Impact:* a steadier, more consistent displayed flip across
  sessions. *Value M-low (you've said the displayed flip is fine) · Effort S.* Cleanliness. (`OPEN_THREADS` §7)
- **Wall-selection distance/DTE guard** — keep a deep-OTM round-number LEAP strike from becoming
  "the wall" far from spot. *Impact:* wall levels stay near the tradable zone. *Value M · Effort S.*
  **Invariant watch:** walls stay the gamma-based max/min net-GEX strike — a guard, not a redefinition.
  Bite only if it shows up live. (`OPEN_THREADS` §7)

### C. Strategic / blocked (high value, gated on a decision or heavy lift)
- **Data-vendor decision + overnight coverage** — Massive vs Databento (Blue Ocean overnight, full
  OPRA) vs Webull (cheap overnight underlying, no options). *Impact:* unlocks the overnight price gap
  — the core coverage hole. *Value H · Effort L.* **Blocked-on:** the cost/eval decision itself
  (verify whether Databento Standard $199 includes Blue Ocean). This is a *decision* before a build.
  (`OPEN_THREADS` §1/§2/§9)
- **Multi-session dark-pool accumulation map** — beyond the current bounded recent window; needs a
  heavier batched pull. *Impact:* see block accumulation across sessions, not just the last hour.
  *Value M · Effort L.* Future. (`OPEN_THREADS` §7/§9)
- **Flip fixed-IV-under-spot-move modeling** — the latent choice of holding IV fixed while repricing
  across the spot grid in the flip search. *Impact:* flip fidelity. *Value TBD · Effort L.*
  **Blocked-on:** measure the divergence first before any calibration (per §9 — judged immaterial so far).

### D. Shipped-feature seams (park until a concrete need pulls them)
- **Ghost-trade → real path** — broker `FillSource`/`PositionStore`, `BundleFeed`+clock replay,
  recorded-verdict reassessment, server-side trade store. *Note:* implies leaving paper-sim for a real
  order path — a deliberate scope shift, not an increment. Park until going live. (`OPEN_THREADS` §5)
- **Observability extensions** — OTel/Prometheus export, latency/headroom alert thresholds,
  persisted cross-restart baselines. *Value M · Effort M.* Pull when operating the service in earnest.
  (`OPEN_THREADS` §6)
- **Multi-ticker scanner** — the observability baseline data supports it. *Value M · Effort M-L.*
  **Invariant watch:** revisits the deliberate "single-ticker, on-demand" decision (the watchlist scan
  was dropped for being too slow) — re-justify before promoting. (`OPEN_THREADS` §6, `GAMMAFLOW_CONTEXT` §5)
- **Persona data single-sourcing (FE↔BE reconciliation)** — the backend ships the canonical
  decomposed template + 7 presets at `GET /api/personas` (transport filed as a late interface
  amendment, after the FE froze), but the FE **embeds** a faithful copy and assembles client-side, so
  the canonical preset/prompt data is **dual-sourced** (drift risk). *Impact:* an operator edit to a
  preset/prompt would reach the AI briefing instead of silently diverging — concrete need = first time
  presets are edited server-side. *Fix:* FE hydrates presets/template from `GET /api/personas`, keeping
  the embedded copy as offline/assembly-failure fallback. *Value M · Effort S.* Behaviour is correct
  today; not blocking. (`OPEN_THREADS` §7)
- **Persona conservative-disposition cleanup** — UX/FE gave `conservative` the *softened* disposition
  text, but the backend Verification required it to contain "prone to greed"; resolved pragmatically as
  a **superset** (harsh phrase + map text). *Fix:* decide whether conservative should be softened-only
  and amend the prompt template + contract if so. *Value L · Effort S.* (`OPEN_THREADS` §7)
- **Persona deferred extensions** — multi-device sync, operator-shared persona library, richer
  customization knobs, per-persona acceptance analytics (decision-history harvest). *Value M · Effort
  M.* Park until a concrete need pulls them. (`OPEN_THREADS` §7)
