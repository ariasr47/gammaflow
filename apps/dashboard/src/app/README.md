# `app/` — feature map

One directory per feature surface. Shared code flows **downward only** (feature dirs may import
`ui/`, `trading/`, `tokens.ts`; never the reverse).

| Directory | Feature |
| --- | --- |
| `ticker/` | The Ticker viewer — command deck, widget bento board (`ticker/widgets/*`), bundle poll + page-scoped SSE. |
| `positions/` | The Positions portfolio — durable multi-position book, entry resolver (`entry.ts`), customization/saved views, gated writes. |
| `ghost-trade/` | **Retains the single-trade tracked-contract / mark / reassessment engine the Ticker page uses** (`useGhostTrade`, `mark.ts`, `store.ts`, tier metadata). Its old entry dialog moved to `trading/`; merging this engine into `positions/` is a future, riskier feature — renamed nothing this pass. |
| `trading/` | Shared sim-entry: `TradeEntryDialog` — the ONE dialog both the Ticker and Positions pages launch (SIMULATED, paper-only; the host owns the write). |
| `ai-rec/` | The AI recommendation panel, Accept→prefill seam (`prefill.ts`), structured-state export drawer. |
| `personas/` | Read personas — presets, customize form, durable persona store. |
| `auth/` | Accounts — session context, sign-in dialog, gated-action helper (`useGate`), settings page. |
| `scanner/` | Scanner page (static coming-soon). |
| `landing/` | The `/` landing surface. |
| `shell/` | Persistent app shell — top nav, footer, brand mark. |
| `ui/` | Shared presentational primitives (props in → MUI out). |
| `durable/` | Durable-store invariants (migration/brand suites live here). |
| `operator-metrics/` + `operator-metrics.tsx` | Operator-only `/_ops/metrics` readout — off the trader shell. |
| `tokens.ts` / `theme.ts` | Design tokens (single source, synced with Figma) + the MUI theme built from them. Never hardcode a hex in a component. |
| `app.tsx` | The route table only, wrapped in the auth/theme/dialog providers. |
